        <h3>Twitch</h3>
        <p> I offer moderation of Twitch streams. This includes enforcing the chat rules as set by the streamer, up to and including 
            either timing out or banning those who break said rules. This also includes welcoming in new chatters and keeping 
            conversations. I can also work with your StreamElements or Nightbot accounts to create and edit commands.

        <h3>Discord</h3>
        <p> I offer configuration as well as moderation of Discord servers. This includes, but is not limited to, creating channels,
            welcoming in new members, managing appropriate bots, enforcing server rules as set forth by the streamer up to and including
            either timing out or banning those who break said rules. I will maintain a presence in the Discord server so the streamer does
            not have to.
