      <h3><a href="https://twitch.tv/officedrummer">OfficeDrummer</a></h3>
      <p>I have worked with Papa Squatch for almost 2 years now. In that time he has exceeded every expectation. I began
         working with him while I was streaming on Reddit and he has followed me to Twitch and TikTok as well. Squatch 
         is a large reason why our Discord server has grown to be what it is today. He keeps it safe and adds fun new 
         channels and features to keep folks entertained. He is always willing to lend a hand and is just an overall 
         great presence.
      </p>


      <h3><a href="https://twitch.tv/explosioninvasion">ExplosionInvasion</a></h3>
      <p>Squatch as been with us in ExplosionInvasion for around a year and a half now. He found us while we were on RPAN 
         and made the switch with us to Twitch. Whenever a stream is missing that something extra, Squatch has been able to
         find it an implement it on the fly. While he's been with us, he has also kept our Discord safe. We appreaciate all
         that he does.

        <h3><a href="https://twitch.tv/sarcasticsincerity">SarcasticSincerity</a></h3>
        <p>I have been colleagues with Squatch for almost two years, and I can attest that he is a total legend at moderating 
            Discord, Twitch, and the great forests of the Pacific Northwest. Squatch is so reliable and capable that many find 
            it difficult to believe he really exists. He can wrangle bots and ban bad guys even faster than he can outrun 
            photographers. Some consider the Papa Squatch Nightbot command to be the highest honor known to man, beast, or cryptid.
            Any community he is a part of will be greatly improved by his technological savvy, kindness, pumpkin spice memes, 
            dad jokes, and immaculate dance moves. I personally guarantee that hiring Squatch would be a huge W.
